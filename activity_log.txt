Downloaded CubeIDE and basic files(Datasheets, etc.)
Finished course content Section 2: Had no problems following

Comment:
I think 'CubeIDE' will be a better editing IDE than 'Keil uVision5'. Had problems where 'Keil uVision5' wasn't able to detect files in its own folder. To use 'CubeIDE' we need to download the 'stm32l4xx.h' file seperatly, and change some settings.

Worked on a prototype for the Lab PPT
Need further feedback

Comment:
I skipped the part where it talks about using '#define' to set  offsets for the code, because it would be confusing for the students and I think a lecture will be better than a lab to explain it. If the professor thinks that the '#define' part is needed then I will try to add it to the PPT.

Added board schematic to files(to find the button / LED pins)
Finished USART2 implementation
Added PPT '2. GPIO'



12/20/2022
Finished code + comment for USART
Added PPT '3. USART'

Comment:
The length of the PPT is long so it might be better to divide the part for 2 classes.

12/21/2022
Finished code + comment for ADC
Added PPT '4. ADC + Debug'

Comment:
Will not be able to update for a bit due to having my birthday + christmas + mothers birthday. Will try to watch the videos through other means.
For the ADC, I just tested using regular resistors, but I think that it will be better for the students to use the resistors that can change the resistance by turning it.
